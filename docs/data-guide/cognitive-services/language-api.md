# Types of language API services

Azure AI Language is a cloud-based service that provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) features for understanding and analyzing text. This service can help you build intelligent applications. It provides tools like the web-based Language Studio, REST APIs, and client libraries.

## Services

Here are some details about language API services:

- [Azure Cognitive Service for Language](/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/overview) provides several NLP features for understanding and analyzing text. This service brings together Text Analytics, QnA Maker, and LUIS. These features can be:
  - Preconfigured, which means that the AI models the feature uses aren't customizable. You just send your data and use the feature's output in your applications.
  - Customizable, which means that you use Azure AI services tools to train an AI model to fit your data.
- [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/) provides REST API access to powerful OpenAI language models, including GPT-3, Codex, and embeddings. You can easily adopt these models to your specific task. Tasks include content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural-language-to-code translation. You can access the service via REST APIs, a Python SDK, or the web-based interface in Azure OpenAI Studio.
- [Cognitive Services Translator](/azure/cognitive-services/translator/translator-overview) is a translation service that provides text-to-text APIs.
- [QnA Maker](/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/overview/overview) is a cloud-based NLP service that you can use to create a natural conversational layer over your data.
