Digital transformation is imperative for any business thatâ€™s trying to compete in the marketplace. This transformation demands timely access to data and data insights, fueling new business processes and client experiences, which might cause an overlooked or misunderstood effect to existing applications and data. The demand for streamlined access has led to an integration approach that relies on Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs based on industry standards. This architecture shows how IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack with standards-based REST APIs achieves a low-code solution for mainframe subsystems.

## Overview

This architecture extends mainframe applications to Azure without disruptions or modifications to existing mainframe applications. IBM z/OS Connect, a component of IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack, is used to provide a more reliable and more secure connectivity between applications on Azure and applications and data on z/OS. Its purpose is to integrate and provide access to the data and services available on the mainframe.

IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack and z/OS Connect are easily deployed on Azure via Azure Marketplace or Azure Resource Manager templates. When you use this solution, you can build REST APIs for z/OS applications and data while adhering to OpenAPI standards. This approach allows you to scale business-critical application programming interfaces (APIs) and take advantage of the strengths of IBM Z. Seamless integration with API management solutions like [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/api-management/) ensures effective API governance. You can integrate APIs with web applications or Microsoft Power Platform for efficient data exchange and integration.

## Workflow

Take the following steps to create and deploy APIs for mainframe applications by using a contract-first approach:

1. Import an OpenAPI v3 (OAS3) declarative JSON API schema file into the z/OS Connect Designer. For more information, see [What is the z/OS Connect Designer?](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/z-modernization-stack/2023.2?topic=concepts-what-is-zos-connect-designer)
1. Use z/OS Connect Designer to [Map your API and z/OS Assets](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/z-modernization-stack/2023.2?topic=designer-mapping-your-rest-api-operations-zos-assets).
1. Test the functionality of the APIs by interacting with core z/OS applications and push the mappings into source control management (SCM).
1. Build a web archive (WAR) file and run the production in [the z/OS Connect Server image](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/z-modernization-stack/2023.2?topic=server-zos-connect-image).
1. Import the OAS3 specification into [API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/api-management/) and establish a connection with the z/OS Connect Server.
1. Enable and enforce API authentication and authorization mechanisms by using Microsoft Entra ID for enhanced security. For more information, see [Authentication and authorization to APIs in Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/authentication-authorization-overview).

Access mainframe applications through Azure by:

- Signing in to Microsoft Entra ID (step 6 in the image), which provides access to the client application. The client applications also communicate with Microsoft Entra ID for authentication and authorization of access to resources.
- Accessing client applications such as Power Apps or a custom web app (step 7 in the image), which then access the mainframe applications through REST API access to IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack.

The steps taken by IT staff to monitor the system with Azure tools and implement disaster recovery measures by using Azure Site Recovery include:

- Deploy new or enhanced applications (step 7 in the image) to consume the REST API interfaces exposed through API Management.
- Use Azure Application Monitor and Application Insights (step 8 in the image) to monitor Power Platform, the application APIs, and security.
- Use Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery (step 9 in the image).

## Potential use cases

Benefits from using REST APIs to access mainframe applications include:

- *Frontend applications*: Front-end applications written in Java, Java EE, .NET Framework, and C and C++ can use REST APIs for mainframe applications. These applications can share business logic and units of work with back-end Customer Information Control System (CICS) applications developed in COBOL, PL/I, and other languages. This integration allows for communication between the front-end and back-end systems for efficient data exchange and processing.

- *Hybrid solutions with citizen developers*: REST APIs in mainframe applications help citizen developers within enterprises build hybrid solutions. Citizen developers can use mainframe APIs and other APIs available within their organization to create innovative applications and integrations. This democratization of API access allows for faster development cycles and promotes collaboration between different teams.

REST APIs in mainframe applications offer opportunities for modernization and expansion while preserving the essential business logic and data integrity of the mainframe systems. REST APIs in mainframe applications support an array of front-end technologies and empower citizen developers.
