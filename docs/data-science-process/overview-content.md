The TDSP is an agile and iterative data science methodology that you can use to deliver predictive analytics solutions and AI applications efficiently. The TDSP enhances team collaboration and learning by recommending optimal ways for team roles to work together. The TDSP incorporates best practices and frameworks from Microsoft and other industry leaders to help your team effectively implement data science initiatives. The TDSP enables you to fully realize the benefits of your analytics program.

This article provides an overview of the TDSP and its main components. It presents guidance about how to implement the TDSP by using Microsoft tools and infrastructure. You can find more detailed resources throughout the article.

## Key components of the TDSP

The TDSP has the following key components:

- **Data science lifecycle** definition
- **Standardized project structure**
- **Infrastructure and resources** that are ideal for data science projects
- **Responsible AI**: and a commitment to the advancement of AI, driven by ethical principles

### Data science lifecycle

The TDSP provides a lifecycle that you can use to structure the development of your data science projects. The lifecycle outlines the full steps that successful projects follow.

You can combine the task-based TDSP with other data science lifecycles, such as cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM), the knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process, or another custom process. At a high level, these different methodologies have much in common.

Use this lifecycle if you have a data science project that's part of an intelligent application. Intelligent applications deploy machine learning or AI models for predictive analytics. You can also use this process for exploratory data science projects and improvised analytics projects.

The TDSP lifecycle consists of five major stages that your team performs iteratively. These stages include:

- [Business understanding](lifecycle-business-understanding.md)
- [Data acquisition and understanding](lifecycle-data.md)
- [Modeling](lifecycle-modeling.md)
- [Deployment](lifecycle-deployment.md)
- [Customer acceptance](lifecycle-acceptance.md)

Here's a visual representation of the TDSP lifecycle:

[![Diagram that shows the stages of the TDSP lifecycle.](./media/lifecycle/tdsp-lifecycle2.png)](./media/lifecycle/tdsp-lifecycle2.png)

For more information about the goals, tasks, and documentation artifacts for each stage, see [The TDSP lifecycle](lifecycle.md).

These tasks and artifacts align with project roles, such as:

- Solution architect
- Project manager
- Data engineer
- Data scientist
- Application developer
- Project lead

The following diagram shows the tasks (in blue) and artifacts (in green) that correspond to each stage of the lifecycle depicted on the horizontal axis and for the roles depicted on the vertical axis.

### Standardized project structure

Your team can use the Azure infrastructure to organize your data science assets.

Azure Machine Learning supports the open-source [MLflow](/azure/machine-learning/concept-mlflow?view=azureml-api-2). We recommend that you use MLflow for data science and AI project management. MLflow is designed to manage the complete machine learning lifecycle. It trains and serves models on different platforms, so that you can use a consistent set of tools regardless of where your experiments run. You can use MLflow locally on your computer, on a remote compute target, on a virtual machine, or on a machine learning compute instance.

MLflow consists of several key functionalities:

- **Track experiments**: You can use MLflow to keep track of experiments, including parameters, code versions, metrics, and output files. This feature helps you compare different runs and efficiently manage the experimentation process.

- **Package code**: It provides a standardized format for packaging machine learning code, which includes dependencies and configurations. This packaging makes it easier to reproduce runs and share code with others.

- **Manage models**: MLflow provides functionalities to manage and version models. It supports various machine learning frameworks so that you can store, version, and serve models.

- **Serve and deploy models**: MLflow integrates model serving and deployment capabilities so that you can easily deploy models in diverse environments.

- **Register models**: You can manage the lifecycle of a model, which includes versioning, stage transitions, and annotations. You can use MLflow to maintain a centralized model store in a collaborative environment.

- **Use an API and UI**: Inside Azure, MLflow is bundled within the Machine Learning API version 2, so you can interact with the system programmatically. You can use the Azure portal to interact with a UI.

MLflow simplifies and standardizes the process of machine learning development, from experimentation to deployment.

Machine Learning [integrates with Git repositories](/azure/machine-learning/concept-train-model-git-integration?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=python), so that you can use Git-compatible services, such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, or another Git-compatible service. In addition to the assets that are already tracked in Machine Learning, your team can develop their own taxonomy within their Git-compatible service to store other project data, such as:

- Documentation
  - Project data: such as, the final project report
  - Data report: such as, the data dictionary or data quality reports
  - Model: such as, model reports
- Code
  - Data preparation
  - Model development
  - Operationalization, which includes security and compliance
